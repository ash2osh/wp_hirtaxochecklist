# wp_hirtaxochecklist
 hierarchical taxonomies checklist checking
 this wordpress plugin allows hierarchical checklists to be checked up/down the tree
 on parent selection all childs are selected
 or on child selection parent is selected

this can also be used on frontend  but the output of wp_terms_checklist( must be wrapped in <ul id="{termname}checklist"
 
 <h3>disclaimer : I have only tested it on 1 depth level</h3>
